# Simple PDF Rearrange

A Java Swing Utility to rearrange, delete, rotate pages or merge PDFs.

Click the PDFs to select them and right click to perform several actions. Depending on the amount of selected PDFs,
these actions are available:

- 0 Save
- 2 Swap
- 2 Insert second before first
- 2 Insert first after second
- 1+ Delete
- 1+ Rotate 90Â°
- \* Insert from file at end of document

Drag a PDF file into the frame to append it to the document. This is also the only way to load a new PDF.
